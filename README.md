### Pattern Recognition :

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the theory and practice of pattern recognition. Students will explore fundamental concepts such as classification, clustering, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction. The course covers both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, emphasizing their applications in various domains like image processing, speech recognition, and bioinformatics.

Through a combination of theoretical lectures and practical assignments, students will learn to design and implement algorithms for recognizing patterns in data. Topics include Bayesian decision theory, neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, and ensemble methods. The course also delves into modern approaches such as deep learning and their role in advancing pattern recognition.

By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the skills necessary to tackle real-world problems involving pattern recognition, preparing them for careers in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
